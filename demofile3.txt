​

Middle-aged male with a history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and prediabetes on atorvastatin and aspirin, presenting with new-onset chest pain radiating to arms and jaw for 2 hours, unrelieved by rest or additional aspirin dosage.​

Upon initial evaluation, Mr. Smith presented to the hospital with a chief complaint of chest pain that started approximately two hours ago while he was gardening. He described the pain as a dull pressure in the middle of his chest that sometimes radiated to his left and right arms and even up to his jaw. He attempted to alleviate the pain by resting and taking an extra dose of aspirin, but the pain persisted. With a past medical history significant for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar, Mr. Smith was on atorvastatin and aspirin, among other medications.

Given the concerning symptoms and cardiac risk factors, Mr. Smith underwent diagnostic testing including an EKG to evaluate his heart rhythm, blood tests to assess cardiac markers, and an ultrasound of the heart to assess cardiac function. Additionally, nitroglycerin was administered to help alleviate the chest pain.

Currently, Mr. Smith is stable and under observation in the hospital to monitor his condition. Further evaluation and management will depend on the results of the diagnostic tests. He is being closely monitored, and interventions will be tailored to his specific needs and condition. Further updates on his progress will be provided as more information becomes available.​

1. Two hours ago, the patient started feeling chest pain while gardening.
2. The chest pain is described as a dull pressure in the middle of the chest that radiates to the left and right arms and sometimes up to the jaw.
3. The patient has a history of high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol.
4. The patient takes atorvastatin daily for high cholesterol.
5. The patient also takes daily aspirin.
6. The patient took an extra dose of aspirin this morning which did not relieve the pain.
7. Resting did not improve the chest pain.
8. The chest pain has never been experienced before.
9. The patient feels a squeezing sensation on the heart with the chest pain.
10. The doctor plans to conduct an EKG, blood tests, and an ultrasound of the heart to evaluate further.​

Based on the patient's presentation of chest pain, radiating to the left and right arms and jaw, with associated risk factors including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar, the top clinical differentials to consider include:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (Unstable Angina or Myocardial Infarction) - Given the patient's risk factors and the nature of the chest pain radiating to the arms and jaw, cardiac etiology should be considered first.
2. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) - Chest pain can also be due to acid reflux, especially if there is a history of heartburn or regurgitation.
3. Aortic Dissection - Although less common, aortic dissection can present with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the back.
4. Pulmonary Embolism - Chest pain associated with shortness of breath and risk factors such as immobility or recent surgery should also be considered.
5. Costochondritis - Inflammation of the cartilage that connects a rib to the sternum can cause chest pain, especially with palpation.

Prognosis and clinical stability:
Due to the nature of the chest pain and the patient's risk factors, the concern for a cardiac event such as acute coronary syndrome is high. Prompt evaluation and treatment are essential in this situation. The patient is currently stable, but close monitoring is warranted given the potential severity of the differential diagnoses. Initiating nitroglycerin for pain relief is appropriate, and further diagnostic tests will provide more information to guide the management plan. The prognosis will depend on the underlying cause of the chest pain and the timely intervention provided.​

Clinical Plan:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS):
- Summary: Mr. Smith presents with new-onset chest pain described as a dull pressure in the center of his chest, radiating to his left and right arms and jaw. History of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and atorvastatin use, along with inadequate relief from rest and aspirin, raises concern for ACS.
- Consult: Cardiology for further evaluation and management.
- Diagnostics: EKG to assess for any cardiac rhythm abnormalities, troponin levels to evaluate for myocardial damage, lipid panel to monitor cholesterol levels, and glucose levels to assess for possible diabetes.
- Treatment: Administer nitroglycerin sublingually for pain relief. Standard dosing is 0.3-0.4 mg sublingually every 5 minutes for up to three doses as needed for chest pain. Monitor blood pressure closely due to potential hypotensive effects. Consider initiating antiplatelet therapy with aspirin if not contraindicated.

2. Hypertension:
- Summary: History of high blood pressure.
- Consult: Cardiology for optimization of blood pressure management.
- Treatment: Initiate or adjust antihypertensive medication based on blood pressure measurements. For example, consider starting an ACE inhibitor or calcium channel blocker. Monitor for potential drug interactions with current medications.

3. Hyperlipidemia:
- Summary: History of high cholesterol and atorvastatin use.
- Consult: Cardiology for lipid management.
- Treatment: Continue current atorvastatin therapy. Consider lifestyle modifications such as dietary changes and increased physical activity. Monitor lipid levels regularly and adjust medication as needed to achieve target levels.

4. Diabetes Mellitus:
- Summary: High blood sugar levels without meeting criteria for diabetes.
- Treatment: Monitor blood glucose levels closely and provide education on lifestyle modifications to prevent progression to diabetes. Consider referral to an endocrinologist for further management.

5. Medication Reconciliation:
- Summary: History of atorvastatin, aspirin, and potential future medications for ACS, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
- Treatment: Review current medication list for potential interactions and adjust doses as needed. Consider providing a medication list and schedule for adherence.

6. Lifestyle Modifications:
- Summary: History of chest pain with possible cardiac etiology.
- Treatment: Educate on the importance of lifestyle changes including a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, and stress management to reduce cardiovascular risk factors. Consider referral to a cardiac rehabilitation program for further support.

Follow-up:
- Schedule a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist for further evaluation, management, and long-term care planning.
- Educate Mr. Smith on signs and symptoms of ACS and when to seek immediate medical attention.
- Provide resources for cardiac rehabilitation programs and support groups for ongoing cardiovascular health management.

Note: Dosages provided are general recommendations and should be individualized based on patient-specific factors. Consultation with a healthcare provider is recommended before initiating any new medications or treatment.
