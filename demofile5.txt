Clinical Plan:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) - Given Mr. Smith's presentation of new-onset chest pain radiating to multiple locations, the top concern is ACS.

- Consultant Services: Cardiology
- Diagnostic Tests:
  - EKG to assess heart rhythm and look for ST-segment changes suggestive of ischemia.
  - Blood tests (troponin levels) to evaluate cardiac enzymes for evidence of myocardial damage.
  - Transthoracic echocardiogram to visualize heart structures and assess for any wall motion abnormalities.
- Treatment:
  - Nitroglycerin for chest pain relief and to reduce cardiac workload.
  - Aspirin therapy to inhibit platelet aggregation (already on aspirin).
  - Consideration of additional antiplatelet therapy (e.g., clopidogrel) and anticoagulation based on cardiology recommendations.
  - Beta-blockers for their anti-ischemic and heart-protective effects.
  - Statin therapy (if not contraindicated) for lipid management.
  - Administration of supplemental oxygen if oxygen saturation is decreased.
- Dosages:
  - Nitroglycerin sublingual tablet: 0.4 mg to be taken every 5 minutes for a maximum of 3 doses.
  - Aspirin 325 mg to chew as a loading dose, followed by 81-325 mg orally once daily.
  - Clopidogrel loading dose of 300 mg, followed by 75 mg once daily.
  - Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours based on weight if anticoagulation is initiated.
  - Metoprolol tartrate 5 mg IV every 5 minutes for a total of 3 doses, followed by 25-100 mg orally twice daily. Dosage adjustments based on heart rate and blood pressure.
  
2. High Blood Pressure - Mr. Smith's history of hypertension is a contributing risk factor for cardiovascular events.

- Consultant Services: Internal Medicine
- Diagnostic Tests: Monitor blood pressure, electrolytes, and kidney function.
- Treatment:
  - Initiate antihypertensive therapy if blood pressure is elevated or not well controlled.
  - Consider medications such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics based on individual response and comorbidities.
- Dosages: Dosage should be individualized based on Mr. Smith's blood pressure goal and any contraindications or side effects.

3. High Cholesterol - Given his history of high cholesterol and being on atorvastatin, lipid management is crucial for cardiovascular risk reduction.

- Consultant Services: Cardiology/Internal Medicine
- Diagnostic Tests: Lipid panel to assess lipid levels and adjust therapy if necessary.
- Treatment:
  - Maintain atorvastatin therapy and consider up-titration based on lipid levels and cardiovascular risk.
  - Lifestyle modifications including diet adjustments, exercise, and smoking cessation if applicable.
- Dosages: Atorvastatin dosages should be based on lipid profile targets and individual response.

4. High Blood Sugar - Mr. Smith's history of high blood sugar requires monitoring and management, especially in the context of acute cardiac events.

- Consultant Services: Endocrinology/Diabetology
- Diagnostic Tests: Blood glucose monitoring
- Treatment:
  - Monitor blood glucose levels closely and maintain glycemic control.
  - Adjust diabetes medications (if applicable) to optimize blood sugar levels.
  - Ensure adequate nutrition and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
- Dosages: Insulin or oral hypoglycemic dosages should be individualized based on blood glucose levels and response.

5. Referral for Cardiac Rehabilitation - Once stabilized, consider referral to a cardiac rehabilitation program to improve Mr. Smith's cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of future events.

6. Psychological Support - Given the stress of experiencing chest pain and potential cardiac issues, consider providing psychological support to help manage anxiety and stress, which can impact overall cardiovascular health.
