Clinical Plan:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction or Unstable Angina):
   
   Summary: Mr. Smith's presentation of acute onset chest pain radiating to the left arm and jaw, along with his history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and high blood sugar, raises concern for acute coronary syndrome.
   
   Consultant Services:
   - Cardiology Consult for further evaluation and management.

   Diagnostics:
   - Continuous EKG monitoring.
   - Serial Troponin measurements.
   - Transthoracic echocardiogram to assess cardiac function.
   - NTpro-BNP, Hemoglobin A1c, Lipid Panel, TSH, HIV testing.
   
   Treatments:
   - Aspirin 81mg daily for antiplatelet therapy.
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily for lipid management.
   - Sublingual Nitroglycerin 0.4mg as needed for chest pain.
   - Heparin infusion as per ACS protocol.
   - Await cardiology recommendations on the timing of coronary angiogram and possible intervention.
   - Consider initiation of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors post-cardiac intervention.

   Medications:
   - Aspirin 81mg PO daily.
   - Atorvastatin 80mg PO daily.
   - Sublingual Nitroglycerin 0.4mg PRN for chest pain.
   - Heparin infusion per protocol.
   - Beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors post-intervention.

   Calculations:
   - Adjust Heparin infusion based on weight and PTT monitoring.
   - Cardiovascular medications dosages typically indicated for the conditions.

The clinical team should closely monitor Mr. Smith's cardiac status, response to treatments, and collaborate with cardiology for further interventions as needed. Proper management of acute coronary syndrome is crucial to prevent complications and ensure optimal outcomes for the patient. Regular follow-ups and lifestyle modifications may also be necessary to address underlying risk factors contributing to his cardiac condition.
