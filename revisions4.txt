Provide a clinical assessment based on the past medical history and history of present illness. This assessment should include a number of top clinical differentials in descending order of probability. It should also provide a preliminary assessment of the clinical prognosis for the patient and comment on their current clinical stability.:


Example 1: 

Hi Mr. Smith. My name is Dr. Zhang and I'll be taking care of you today. What brings you in? Well doc, I've been feeling quite a lot of belly pain recently and I feel like my belly's getting bigger and I feel like there's just got a lot of fluid in it and even when I walk around it you know I can feel it moving in there and really it's making it a little bit hard to move around for me and it's making me a little bit hard to breathe. Oh I'm sorry to hear that. When did this first start? Well it really started quite a while back now. I mean I feel like I've you know had a drinking problem for years now and typically I you know I drink at least a couple of shots of whiskey per day. Sometimes I you know I chase it down maybe with a couple glasses of wine as well. I know it's bad for me but it's really been going on for quite some time and I feel like recently I went to my primary care doctor and they said that me you know I may have a liver problem and they recommended a slew of tests and I didn't know yet how important it was and I I guess I didn't really see it as that important to get it so I you know I didn't really get the labs and the imaging that they recommended and I feel like now it's all catching up to me. Well it's okay you don't have to blame yourself. I just want to hear a little bit more about this pain that you have. Well yeah so I don't know recently you know I it was just that I feel like my stomach has been like I said getting bigger over the past few months maybe even up you know up for the past year and it feels like I get I you know when I eat I get full sooner and it's you know just been harder for me to get around and I get more winded more easily but really over the past week I started to feel sort of belly pain and it I don't know like you know it just feels like a dull pain and whenever I press on my belly it gets it definitely makes it worse and I would say it's probably worse and right over here on the right side near the top of you know near near the top of my stomach okay well I'm sorry to hear that what other symptoms have you had have you had any nausea or vomiting well yeah sometimes I have a little bit of nausea I haven't really had any significant vomiting sometimes I have a little retching but I've never really vomited much up so so you definitely never had any bloody vomiting right no I haven't and have you had any diarrhea or constipation well you know now that you mentioned it I think in the past couple days I do I you know I did have a couple episodes of loose stool sort of watery and you know I didn't feel too good afterwards either and did this you know did those stools have blood in them no not really no blood I didn't see anything so no blood in you know you didn't have any bloody vomiting or bloody stools yeah I guess so that's that's correct okay well that that's at least reassuring okay so tell me more about this liver issue that you've been having well yeah like I told you my primary care doctor has said in the past that because of the the way that I eat and I know I'm not really eating that well I you know I I don't really watch what I eat and I do I do have a sweet tooth so I tend to eat a lot of sugary things on the daily and you know I love potatoes bread and I know it's bad for me and really I do admit that I have a drinking problem and I do go to my meetings for it but you know it's been hard any with the with the stresses of my work and it's just hard to keep up with things yeah so I like I said I've been maybe drinking a couple shots of whiskey per day sometimes you know a couple wine glasses of wine on top of that that's okay well thanks for being honest with us well is it you know did you ever get any labs or imaging done for your liver like I said yeah my primary care doctor really recommended a couple things they noticed that something my maybe my liver numbers were up but I didn't really follow up on it and they recommended I think you know to get some some pictures taken of my liver and I didn't really go and get that either so but I now I feel like it's reached gotten to a point where I really need to get checked out so that's why I'm here and yeah I think you made a great decision by coming in today and I was wondering if you have any other sort of medical issues that I would need to know about yeah you know people have said that I have you know high cholesterol and I think I have I have diabetes as well though I you know I take metformin for it and I think I you know I miss a couple heat doses here and there but for the most part I take it pretty well and yeah I think I think that's about it and have you had any surgeries in the past well I had my appendix appendix out you know from I was a young man still and but that's over 20 years ago okay well thank you and I know you about your you know that you're drinking issues and thank you for telling me that by the way it must take a lot of courage to say and what about smoking do you smoke yeah you know I I used to smoke about maybe half a pack a day for for you know for a good good 20 30 years but now I don't and yeah and do you use any other you know herbal supplements any other substances at all that I you know that you would want me to know no no I don't really take any supplements I do take some vitamins from time to time but not regularly okay well thanks for that that's very and that's very helpful and what do you do for work mr.

History of Present Illness - Mr. Smith presented to the hospital with complaints of worsening abdominal pain and
distension, along with difficulty breathing. He reported a history of chronic alcohol use
and poor dietary habits, noting that his primary care physician had previously suggested
he may have a liver issue due to elevated liver enzymes. He mentioned neglecting to
follow up on recommended tests and imaging in the past.
Upon further questioning, Mr. Smith described experiencing a gradual increase in
abdominal size over the past few months, early satiety with meals, and recent onset of
dull, localized pain on the right side of his abdomen. He denied any nausea, vomiting,
bloody stools, or bloody vomit. He did report episodes of loose stools in the past couple
of days.
In addition to his history of chronic alcohol use, Mr. Smith admitted to a past smoking
habit and a sedentary lifestyle due to his occupation as a software engineer. He also
reported a history of high cholesterol, diabetes treated with metformin, and a family
history of heart disease and diabetes.

Key Elements - 

Alcohol Use Disorder
Unhealthy eating habits
History of Hypercholesterolemia
Diabetes
Family history of cardiovascular and liver disease
Abdominal pain and distension
Early satiety with meals
Recent onset of right-sided abdominal pain
History of smoking and sedentary lifestyle.


Clinical Assessment:

Based on Mr. Smith's past medical history and the details of his current presentation, the
top clinical differentials for his abdominal pain and distension are as follows:
Alcoholic liver disease (most likely given history of alcohol use)
Fatty liver disease (possible given dietary indiscretions)
Ascites (as evident by abdominal distension and subjective feeling of fluid shifts)
Pancreatitis (possible given epigastric pain)
Gastritis or peptic ulcer disease (possible given epigastric pain)
Gallbladder issues (possible given epigastric or RUQ pain)
Given Mr. Smith's chronic alcohol abuse, unhealthy eating habits, and elevated liver
enzymes, liver-related conditions such as alcoholic liver disease or fatty liver disease are
high on the list of differentials. Ascites may also be a concern due to possible liver or
heart-related issues. Pancreatitis is another important consideration due to his alcohol
use. Gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, or gallbladder issues could also be contributing to his
symptoms.


Example 2:


Hi Mr. Smith, my name is Dr. Zhang and I'll be taking care of you today. What brings you in? I've just been feeling a bit of chest pain. In the middle of my chest I feel this sort of pressure and it started about two hours ago and it's just been pretty constant since. Can you tell me a little bit more about this chest pain? What were you doing when it first started? Well I was gardening in my yard and I was pulling out some of the weeds and that's when it first started and I thought maybe I was just tiring myself out a little bit too much so I sat down and gave it five minutes rest and it didn't really get better so I thought maybe I should take an aspirin so that's what I did and that didn't really help either and so at that point my wife told me to come in to get checked out. I think that was a really good decision th
at she made and I'm really glad you came in. Can you tell me a little bit more about your other medical history? Sure, well I do have a primary care doctor that I go to every year for annual health exams and I remember her telling me that I have high blood pressure, my blood sugar is a bit high although she said it's not quite in the range for diabetes yet and she also told me that I have high cholesterol and that's why I'm on atorvastatin which I take every day and I'm also on aspirin like I previously said though I took an extra dose this morning like I told you. Well thank you for that, that was very helpful information and can you tell me a bit more about this pain? As in I know it's centered around your chest, is there any other unique qualities to it that you would, how would you describe it? Well as I said earlier it feels like a bit of dull pressure sort of sitting at the middle of my chest and I do feel it sometimes shooting off to my left and right arms and even up to the jaw. It's nothing like I ever really experienced before and again it's sort of just I feel it squeezing my heart and I got worried and I thought that I should come in just in case that it's something serious. Well again I'm really glad you did come in to get evaluated and yeah so it sounds like you've, I'm just going to summarize what you told me, it sounds like about two hours ago at home when you were gardening you started experiencing this chest pain which you've never had before and it's mostly centered around your chest, it's sort of a dull pressure that's squeezing down on your heart and it sometimes shoots off to your left and your right arm and sometimes even up to the jaw. You've tried resting and that doesn't really make it better and you've also took an extra dose of your aspirin which didn't really relieve the pain either. Does that sound about right? Yeah I think you summed it up pretty well. Okay Mr. Smith no worries we're going to make you more comfortable here and we are going to get some tests going including an EKG which is to look at your heart rhythm and some blood tests to help us look at your heart as well as an ultrasound of your heart so someone will come in and basically help us look at the inside structures of your heart to see if we can better figure out what's going on okay and if the pain gets a lot worse please let us know and we're also going to give you some medications to help alleviate the pain so let us know if that makes you feel better okay it's going to be called nitroglycerin. Okay sure I will let you know so yeah please keep us updated and I'll be back to see you soon all right okay thank you doctor.

Mr. Smith presented to the hospital with chest pain that started about two hours ago while he was gardening. The pain is described as a dull pressure in the middle of his chest, radiating to his left and right arms and up to his jaw. Rest and aspirin did not relieve the pain. Mr. Smith has a history of high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol for which he takes atorvastatin daily and was previously on aspirin.

Upon arrival to the emergency department, Mr. Smith underwent an EKG to assess his heart rhythm, blood tests to evaluate cardiac enzymes, and an ultrasound of his heart to assess cardiac structure and function. He was also given nitroglycerin to help alleviate the chest pain.

Mr. Smith's current condition is stable, with continued monitoring of his chest pain and cardiac status in progress. Further tests and evaluations will be conducted to determine the cause of his chest pain and appropriate management.


Key Elements - 

Hypertension
Hypercholesterolemia
Recent aspirin use
Acute onset chest pressure
Radiating chest pain to arms and jaw
Chest pain started while gardening
Dull pressure in the middle of the chest
Atorvastatin daily use
Previous aspirin use
History of high blood sugar



Clinical Assessment:

Patient Mr. Smith is a 50-year-old man with a past medical history of hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and pre-diabetes who is presenting with the primary complaint of
chest pain and pressure for the past 2 hours with elevated troponins most concerning for
non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. Other less likely diagnoses include new-onset
heart failure, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, pneumonia etc.
