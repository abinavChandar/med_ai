Clinical Assessment:

Based on Mr. Smith's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and high blood sugar, along with his presentation of acute onset chest pain described as a dull pressure in the central chest radiating to the left arm and jaw for the past two hours, the top clinical differentials include:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction or Unstable Angina) - Given the classic presentation of chest pain radiating to the arms and jaw, along with risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and high blood sugar.

2. Myocardial Infarction - Considered given the severity and radiation of the chest pain.

3. Angina Pectoris - Considering the description of chest pain and risk factors.

4. Aortic Dissection - Although less likely, it should be considered due to chest pain radiating to the back.

Initial assessment suggests a high suspicion for cardiac etiology, specifically acute coronary syndrome, given the clinical presentation and risk factors. Prompt evaluation, including cardiac enzyme monitoring, imaging studies, and further cardiac workup, is essential to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate management. Prognosis will depend on the underlying cause of the chest pain and the timeliness of intervention. Mr. Smith's stable condition and ongoing monitoring are critical for timely diagnosis and management.
