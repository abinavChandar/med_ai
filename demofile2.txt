History of Present Illness: Mr. Smith presented to the hospital with chest pain that started about two hours ago while he was gardening. The pain is described as a dull pressure in the middle of his chest, radiating to his left and right arms and up to his jaw. Rest and aspirin did not relieve the pain. Mr. Smith has a history of high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol for which he takes atorvastatin daily and was previously on aspirin.

Upon arrival to the emergency department, Mr. Smith underwent an EKG to assess his heart rhythm, blood tests to evaluate cardiac enzymes, and an ultrasound of his heart to assess cardiac structure and function. He was also given nitroglycerin to help alleviate the chest pain.

Mr. Smith's current condition is stable, with continued monitoring of his chest pain and cardiac status in progress. Further tests and evaluations will be conducted to determine the cause of his chest pain and appropriate management.
