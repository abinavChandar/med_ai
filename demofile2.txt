The patient, Mr. Smith, presented to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain that started approximately two hours ago while he was gardening. The chest pain was described as a dull pressure in the middle of his chest, radiating to his left and right arms as well as up to his jaw. He attempted rest and took an extra dose of aspirin at home, but the pain did not improve. 

Given Mr. Smith's history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar, as well as his presentation of chest pain radiating to his arms and jaw, the healthcare team suspected a cardiac event and initiated diagnostics. An EKG was performed to assess his heart rhythm, blood tests were done to evaluate his cardiac enzymes, and an ultrasound of the heart was planned to visualize the internal structures of the heart.

To alleviate the pain, Mr. Smith was administered nitroglycerin. The healthcare team reassured him and ensured that he was closely monitored for any changes in his symptoms. Mr. Smith's signs and symptoms are currently being managed while awaiting further test results to determine the underlying cause of his chest pain.
